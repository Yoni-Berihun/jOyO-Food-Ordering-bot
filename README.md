## ‚ú® Core Features

Joyo Bot is packed with features designed for both an elegant user experience and powerful backend management.

*   **üåê True Multilingual Support:** Fluent in both **English** and **Amharic**, from the first welcome message to the final order confirmation.
*   **üóÉÔ∏è Fully Database-Driven:** No hardcoded menus! All restaurants, food items, prices, and even photo IDs are dynamically fetched from a lightweight **SQLite database**. This makes the bot scalable and easy to maintain.
*   **üöÄ Real-time Order Forwarding:** The magic happens here. When an order is placed, Joyo instantly sends a detailed notification‚Äîcomplete with a photo‚Äîto a **specific, dedicated topic** within a private Telegram group. This keeps orders perfectly organized for each restaurant.
*   **üì∏ Rich, Interactive Menus:** Users browse high-quality photos of food items, with detailed descriptions and prices, all presented through a clean, button-based interface.
*   **üîê Secure & Organized:** All operations, from user interaction to restaurant notifications, are handled smoothly and securely, ensuring a reliable ordering channel.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: The Technical Magic

The bot's architecture is designed for scalability and ease of management.

1.  **User Interaction:** A user starts the bot and selects their preferred language (Amharic/English). This choice is stored for the entire session.
2.  **Dynamic Generation:** The bot queries the **SQLite database** to fetch the list of available restaurants in the user's chosen language and displays them as buttons.
3.  **Menu Browsing:** When a restaurant is selected, the bot queries the `foods` table for all items linked to that `restaurant_id`.
4.  **Placing an Order:**
    *   The user selects a food item and clicks the "Order Now" button.
    *   The bot logs the transaction in the `orders` table for tracking.
    *   It then queries the `restaurants` table to find the unique `group_id` and `topic_id` for that specific restaurant.
5.  **Instant Notification:** Using the fetched IDs, the bot sends a formatted message containing the customer's details, the full order information (in both languages!), and the food photo directly to the correct topic in the management group.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Running Your Own Joyo Bot

Want to get Joyo Bot up and running? Here's how:

**1. Clone the Repository**

git clone [(https://github.com/Yoni-Berihun/jOyO-Food-Ordering-bot.git)]
cd joyo-bot
2. Install Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt file containing python-telegram-bot and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt```

**3. Set Up Your Telegram Bot**
*   Talk to **@BotFather** on Telegram to create a new bot and get your `API_TOKEN`.
*   Use the `/setprivacy` command with @BotFather to **disable** privacy mode. This is crucial for the bot to work in groups.

**4. Configure the Telegram Group**
*   Create a new, private Telegram group.
*   Enable **Topics** in the group settings.
*   Add your bot to the group and promote it to an **administrator** with permission to "Send Messages" and "Manage Topics".
*   Create a topic for each restaurant (e.g., "Pizza Hut Orders").

**5. Find Your Group & Topic IDs**
*   Temporarily add the `/getids` command handler to your bot (as explained in previous steps).
*   Run your bot and send the `/getids` command inside each topic to get the `group_id` and the unique `topic_id` for each one.

**6. Set Up the Database & Menu**
*   Run the database setup script to create your `food_bot.db` file:
    ```bash
    python database_setup.py
    ```
*   **Populate your database.** You need to manually add your restaurants and food items. You can use a database browser like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) or run SQL commands.

    **Example SQL to add a restaurant:**
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO restaurants (name_en, name_am, group_id, topic_id) 
    VALUES ('Mamas Kitchen', '·àõ·àõ·àµ ·ä™·âΩ·äï', -1001234567890, 15);
    ```

    **Example SQL to add a food item:**
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO foods (restaurant_id, name_en, name_am, price_en, price_am, description_en, description_am, photo_id)
    VALUES (1, 'Doro Wot', '·ã∂·àÆ ·ãà·å•', '250 ETB', '250 ·â•·à≠', 'A delicious stew...', '·å£·çã·å≠ ·ãà·å•...', 'AgACAgQAAxk...NgQ');
    ```

**7. Configure Your Bot**
*   Open `main.py` and replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"` with your actual API token.
*   If you plan to add admin-only features later, pre-fill your user ID in the appropriate handler file.

**8. Launch!**
